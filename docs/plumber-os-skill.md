# PlumberOS Skill

I've created a skill at `~/.claude/skills/plumber-os/SKILL.md` that I use to remember everything about PlumberOS.

## What It Contains

- Project overview and purpose
- Tech stack details
- Current status (what's done, what's not)
- Pages built
- Design references
- Database schema
- Key decisions made
- Future roadmap
- Environment variables needed

## How I Use It

When working on PlumberOS, I check this skill first to:
1. Understand the current project status
2. Reference past decisions
3. Ensure consistency in changes
4. Track progress

## To Update

Edit: `~/.claude/skills/plumber-os/SKILL.md`

This helps me maintain context across sessions about PlumberOS development.
